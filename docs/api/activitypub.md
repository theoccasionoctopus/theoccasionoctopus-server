# ActivityPub

## Following other people

You can follow any other account with ActivityPub functionality, but as most software does not publish Events this may not help.

The other account will not yet get a notification that you followed them. TODO

### Gancio

Click "Follow Me" on an event to get a account name to follow. You can then discover events.

### Mobzillion

If you follow the special account `relay` you can discover all events on a server.

Until [this issue](https://framagit.org/framasoft/mobilizon/-/issues/546) is fixed, it will only get the first page and not get all results.

### Mastodon

As Mastodon does not publish events, following an account there does nothing

## People following you

Any other account with ActivityPub functionality can follow any account here, but this does not do anything yet.

You will not get a notification that someone has followed you. TODO
