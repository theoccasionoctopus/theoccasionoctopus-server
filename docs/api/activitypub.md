# ActivityPub

## Following other people

You can follow any other account with ActivityPub functionality, but as most software does not publish Events this may do nothing.

When you follow another account that does publish events, these will then be available in your "discover" section. 

(However note that these do not update immediately, but only after a bit of time. TODO)

### Gancio

Click "Follow Me" on an event to get a account name to follow. You can then discover events.

### Mastodon

As Mastodon does not publish events, following an account there does nothing.

### Mobzillion

If you follow the special account `relay` you can discover all events on a server.

Until [this issue](https://framagit.org/framasoft/mobilizon/-/issues/546) is fixed, it will only get the first page and not get all results.

## People following you

Any other account with ActivityPub functionality can follow any account here, but this does not do anything yet.
